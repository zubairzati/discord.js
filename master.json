[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) module that allows you to easily interact with the\n[Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).\n\n- Object-oriented\n- Predictable abstractions\n- Performant\n- 100% coverage of the Discord API\n\n## Installation\n\n**Node.js 14.0.0 or newer is required.**  \n\n```sh-session\nnpm install discord.js\n```\n\n### Optional packages\n\n- [zlib-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zlib-sync) for WebSocket data compression and inflation (`npm install zlib-sync`)\n- [erlpack](https://github.com/discord/erlpack) for significantly faster WebSocket data (de)serialisation (`npm install discord/erlpack`)\n- [bufferutil](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bufferutil) for a much faster WebSocket connection (`npm install bufferutil`)\n- [utf-8-validate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/utf-8-validate) in combination with `bufferutil` for much faster WebSocket processing (`npm install utf-8-validate`)\n- [@discordjs/voice](https://github.com/discordjs/voice) for interacting with the Discord Voice API\n\n## Example usage\n\n```js\nconst { Client, Intents } = require('discord.js');\nconst client = new Client({ intents: [Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS, Intents.FLAGS.GUILD_MESSAGES] });\n\nclient.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);\n});\n\nclient.on('message', message => {\n  if (message.content === 'ping') {\n    message.channel.send('pong');\n  }\n});\n\nclient.login('token');\n```\n\n## Links\n\n- [Website](https://discord.js.org/)
